# svelte with xstate inspect and plantuml demo

This is a demo project showing how to 
integrate [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) and [@xstate/inspect](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-inspect) into [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

It also shows how to use [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/) to generate a svg representating 
the [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) statechart as uml diagram.

# getting xstate and @xstate/inspect to run

For this project I created a new Svelte App from the scratch and followed the original guides from the Author of XState ([davidkpiano](https://github.com/davidkpiano)):

- [svelte recipe](https://xstate.js.org/docs/recipes/svelte.html)
- [@xstate/inspect installation](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-inspect/#installation)

# used packages

- [svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/template)
- [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)
- [@xstate/inspect](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/tree/master/packages/xstate-inspect)
